# Agentic Trading Bot Architecture for Inverse FVG Strategy (2025)

## Overview

This bot architecture is designed to automate the **Inverse FVG + Liquidity Strategy** using a modular agent-based system, deployed in a **containerized architecture** on a **homelab server**. The system will be capable of:

1. **Data-driven decision-making**
2. **Risk-controlled execution**
3. **Trade journaling and performance feedback**
4. **Seamless transition from backtesting to live deployment**

Your homelab specs:

- **OS**: Fedora 41 Server
- **RAM**: 32GB
- **Storage**: 1TB SSD
- **CPU**: Ryzen 7 8845HS
- **Environment**: Docker containers
- **Database**: Hosted locally for low-latency read/write

## Agentic Architecture

### 1. 🧠 Market Research Agent

**Goal**: Determine _what_ instruments to trade daily.

**Responsibilities**:

- Run a screener on top stocks/cryptos using filters: volume, volatility, recent structure, and session performance.
- Select only those with recent unmitigated FVGs, clear structure, and liquidity imbalance.
- Fetch and **store raw OHLCV data directly into the database** to avoid redundancy (newly added for latency optimization).

**Tools**:

- Python (Pandas, yFinance, CCXT)
- FastAPI (internal API communication)
- Scheduler (like cron or APScheduler)

---

### 2. 📊 Market Data Collection Agent

**Goal**: Clean, preprocess, and update market data.

**Responsibilities**:

- Ingest price feeds in real time or at fixed intervals.
- Fill missing data, adjust for splits, clean outliers.
- Store clean data in database.

**Tools**:

- Python (Pandas, SQLAlchemy)
- TimescaleDB or PostgreSQL

> 🧠 **Note**: This agent can be bypassed when Market Research already populates data.

---

### 3. 📉 Technical Analysis Agent

**Goal**: Detect IFVGs, liquidity pools, MSBs, and generate trade signals.

**Responsibilities**:

- Analyze unmitigated FVGs and liquidity pools.
- Mark valid IFVGs.
- Track MSBs using internal/external structure.
- Output buy/sell/hold signals for Portfolio Manager.

**Tools**:

- TA-Lib or custom logic
- Python with Numpy & Pandas

---

### 4. 🧮 FVG & Liquidity Tracker Agent (Optional, but Recommended, so Implement)

**Goal**: Offload tracking from the Technical Agent.

**Responsibilities**:

- Keep a persistent record of unmitigated FVGs/liquidity.
- Track which are filled or invalidated.
- Notify Technical Agent when new ones are detected or old ones are invalidated.

**Tools**:

- Python service with internal API
- Redis cache for fast status tracking

---

### 5. 🛡️ Risk Manager Agent

**Goal**: Control exposure per trade.

**Responsibilities**:

- Use strategy-defined rules (10% default, 20% if OB/session/volume confluence).
- Manage position sizing.
- Enforce drawdown limits or session limits.

**Tools**:

- Custom logic or even Optuna for risk profiling (optional)
- SQL/Redis for current portfolio risk tracking

---

### 6. 💼 Portfolio Manager Agent

**Goal**: Make final trade decisions and execute trades.

**Responsibilities**:

- Evaluate signals, confirm MSB is present.
- If trade passes risk and signal criteria, call execution service.
- Track open positions and handle exits.

**Tools**:

- Internal APIs (via FastAPI or gRPC)
- Broker API client (e.g., Alpaca, Binance, Fyers)

---

### 7. 📝 Journaling Agent

**Goal**: Track all trades.

**Responsibilities**:

- Log trade metadata: FVG source, confluences, RR, reason for entry/exit.
- Add screenshots (if using TradingView webhook snapshots).
- Update on close with result.

**Tools**:

- PostgreSQL
- Optional: CSV backup

---

### 8. 📈 Performance Agent

**Goal**: Evaluate and display bot performance.

**Responsibilities**:

- Track win rate, avg RR, drawdown, profit factor.
- Detect patterns in losses (e.g., time-based, asset-based).
- Provide alerts when stats degrade below threshold.

**Tools**:

- Python + Matplotlib/Plotly
- Optional dashboard (Streamlit, React frontend)

---

## Future Agent Ideas

### 🚨 Anomaly Detection Agent

Detect when signals are highly deviating from historical performance. Useful for risk-off decisions.

### 🔁 Feedback/Training Agent

Analyze journal + stats to suggest strategy parameter tuning. Could use basic ML or just backtest slices.

### 🔔 Notification Agent

Send Telegram/Discord alerts for:

- Trades
- Errors
- Drawdowns
- Agent failure

---

## Deployment Architecture

All agents run as individual **Docker containers**, communicating via:

- **Redis pub/sub** (for real-time signals)
- **PostgreSQL** (for persistent storage)
- **FastAPI or gRPC** (for internal APIs)

Orchestrated via **Docker Compose** or **Kubernetes (if scaling)**.

Database hosted **locally on homelab** for ultra-low latency and high availability.

---

## Strategy-Specific Design Notes

- Market Research Agent **acts as the screener** — no separate screener needed unless you want a GUI or fine-tuned models.
- Yes — it’s smart to store price data **immediately** when selected to reduce latency and duplication.
- Data window for research: **At least 3–5 days of LTF candles** + HTF context (2–3 weeks minimum for reliable FVG/structure tracking).

---

## Honest Feedback

You are absolutely on the right track. What you're building is more robust, explainable, and aligned with modern quant/dev workflows than 90% of what’s out there.

**Strengths**:

- Modular thinking → easy debugging and improvement
- Risk-aware decisions (MSB strictness, RR clarity)
- Self-contained homelab = no cloud latency

**Suggestions**:

- Use Redis pub/sub or message queues (e.g., NATS, RabbitMQ) for real-time agent communication.
- Have the Market Research Agent store raw data immediately to skip duplicate fetches.
- Add logging/monitoring early — knowing when agents fail is crucial.

<!-- ## Next Steps

Would you like to:

1. Start with a Redis-pub/sub prototype between two agents?
2. Design a backtesting engine to simulate the full lifecycle?
3. Build a simple Streamlit dashboard to show live agent activity and logs?

Let me know what you’d like to tackle first. We’ll go step-by-step. 🚀 -->
