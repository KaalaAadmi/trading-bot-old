# Technical Analysis Agent

Once your data is:

- Filtered ‚úÖ (Market Research Agent)

- Fetched & stored ‚úÖ (Data Collector Agent)

The Technical Analysis Agent is next in line. Its job is to:

- Analyze the stored OHLCV data

- Detect inverse fair value gaps (IFVGs), structure breaks (MSBs), liquidity zones

- Validate strategy-specific conditions (volume spikes, session time, optional OBs)

- Generate signals for trade evaluation(includes the calculated risk-reward ratio)

## üìÑ Technical Analysis Agent ‚Äî Architecture & Responsibilities

üîß Agent Name
`technical_analysis_agent.py`

## üß† Purpose

Analyze stored HTF and LTF price data to identify:

- Unmitigated Fair Value Gaps

- Market Structure Breaks (MSBs)

- Buy-side / Sell-side liquidity

Confirm confluence rules (volume spikes, session alignment, optional OBs)

‚û°Ô∏è Emit trade candidate signals (Buy/Sell/Hold) to analysis_signals stream or publish to Redis for further evaluation.

### üì• Inputs

- OHLCV data from TimescaleDB

- Ticker/timeframe from the data_collector_channel stream

- Config thresholds (e.g. FVG % height, confluence settings)

### üì§ Outputs

- `trade_signal`: {ticker, timeframe, direction, signal_type, reason, metadata}

- `tracking_info`: For journaling/logging/debugging purposes

### üß© Responsibilities

| Task                       | Description                                          |
| -------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| ‚úÖ Detect IFVGs            | Use gap detection on historical candles              |
| ‚úÖ Track unmitigated FVGs  | Avoid FVGs already revisited or invalidated          |
| ‚úÖ Detect MSBs             | Using internal/external structure (configurable)     |
| ‚úÖ Detect liquidity levels | Swing highs/lows, equal highs/lows                   |
| ‚úÖ Validate entry criteria | Inversion + MSB + one confluence (volume/session/OB) |
| ‚úÖ Emit signals            | Structured message to downstream agents              |

## üß† Key Implementation Details

### üîç Fair Value Gap Logic

```python
if candle_n1['high'] < candle_n3['low']:
    bullish_fvg = (candle_n1['high'], candle_n3['low'])
```

Track if price has re-entered that zone (i.e., "mitigated").

### üîÅ Structure Break (MSB)

- Confirm with HH/LL shift using high/low across N candles.

- Can use zig-zag logic or internal/external MSB rules.

### üî• Volume Spike Filter

Use relative volume:

```python
if current_volume > average_volume * spike_factor:
    confirm_volume_spike = True
```

### üß± Folder & File Structure

```markdown
agents/
technical_analysis/
**init**.py
technical_analysis_agent.py
logic/
fvg_detector.py
msb_detector.py
liquidity_tracker.py
utils/
data_loader.py
validation.py
```

> The configs are already stored in `core/config/settings.yaml` file. So we have to refer to that and use the values stored in the file.

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Things to Keep in Mind

#### ‚ùó Loop Prevention

If you refetch data and retrigger analysis, avoid duplicate signal emissions.

#### ‚ùó FVG Tracking

Don‚Äôt re-signal old FVGs. Track status (mitigated, pending, invalidated).

#### ‚ùó Confluence Logic

Ensure confluence rules don‚Äôt make signal generation too strict. Balance is key.

#### ‚ùó DB Queries

Avoid loading thousands of candles into memory. Use windowed SQL queries.

### üö© Potential Loopholes & Pitfalls

| Problem                      | Recommendation                                                   |
| ---------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Detecting FVGs               | across sessions Anchor analysis to recent completed sessions     |
| Large memory use             | Paginate data load from DB                                       |
| Re-detection of same FVG     | Store detected FVGs in Redis or DB with state (pending/filled)   |
| MSB false positives          | Require structure confirmation + volume spike                    |
| Multiple timeframes mismatch | Ensure LTF/HTF pairing and alignment (from Data Collector Agent) |

### üß† Redis Stream Proposal

After emitting signal:

```json
{
  "ticker": "AAPL",
  "timeframe": "5m",
  "direction": "SELL",
  "reason": "Inverse FVG + MSB + SessionTime",
  "fvg_level": [high, low],
  "liquidity_target": 145.60,
  "stop_loss": 149.25,
  "rr": 2.1
}
```

Published to:

- `analysis_signals` stream

- Used by: Portfolio Manager Agent, Journaling Agent, etc.

## Tracked FVGs & Liquidity Management

### üìä Tracked FVGs & Liquidity Management

The Technical Analysis Agent is responsible for managing and persisting:

- Unmitigated Fair Value Gaps (FVGs) in a table named tracked_fvgs

- Buy-side and Sell-side liquidity levels in a table named tracked_liquidity

### üß† Why the Technical Analysis Agent?

The TA Agent is the only module that:

- Has full candle structure context

- Identifies and confirms FVGs, MSBs, and liquidity targets

- Tracks the lifecycle of FVGs (created ‚Üí filled/invalidated)

- Monitors which liquidity levels have been tapped or remain valid

| On FVG detection       | Add to tracked_fvgs with pending status |
| On mitigation          | Set status to filled or invalidated     |
| On liquidity detection | Add to tracked_liquidity                |
| On price tap           | Set tapped = true, add tap_time         |

### üß† Future Split-Off Option

If performance becomes an issue:

- Offload tracking to a lightweight ‚ÄúFVG Tracker Agent‚Äù

- It can update FVG and liquidity status in the background

### ‚úÖ Why Persist in DB?

- Survives restarts

- Enables detailed journaling and post-trade review

- Helps Portfolio Manager Agent avoid duplicate trades

- Offers audit trail for backtests

| 5Ô∏è‚É£    | Take Entry                | On LTF, after confirmed structure shift (MSB)  |

### üìç Key Points to Understand (very important)

| Point                              | Explanation                                                                                   |
| ---------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| FVG Formation                      | Happens on HTF candles. You find important, high-quality gaps at bigger timeframes.           |
| Monitoring & Entry Trigger         | Happens on LTF, inside the HTF FVG region.                                                    |
| Inversion Confirmation             | You need to see price close inside or opposite direction relative to the HTF FVG, on the LTF. |
| Structure Break Confirmation (MSB) | Must happen on LTF after inversion ‚Äî this is critical to avoid fake moves.                    |

|Targets| Can be set based on LTF liquidity pools but must be aware of HTF structure as a guide.|

## üß† Why This Matters?

- HTF FVGs represent big liquidity imbalances that smart money will eventually attack.

- LTF gives you better timing and precision for when the market actually commits to a move.

- Without LTF confirmation, you risk trying to pre-guess smart money ‚Äî and getting punished for it.

‚úÖ You want the HTF idea + LTF execution.

This way, you combine:

- Power of higher timeframe context

- Speed of lower timeframe execution

- Accuracy of MSB + Inversion triggers

üéØ Visual Summary

```text

[HTF (1h)]

- Find FVGs
- Track them as 'pending'

‚Üì

[LTF (5m)]

- Watch price inside FVG zone
- Confirm inversion candle close
- Confirm MSB structure break
- Apply volume/session/OB filters
- Take entry only if all rules are satisfied
```
